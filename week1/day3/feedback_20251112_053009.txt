suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding comments to explain the purpose of each code block, especially in the second challenge.
- Although the code is functional, explore more efficient methods for cleaning strings if performance becomes critical, especially with very large datasets or complex cleaning requirements.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately implements both challenges as described in the chapter content. Challenge 1 correctly creates a dictionary of letter indices, and Challenge 2 correctly determines affordable items and sorts them alphabetically. The inclusion of the Caesar Cipher is beyond the requirements, but doesn't detract from the core challenges being solved correctly.
- readability: The code is generally well-structured and easy to follow. Meaningful variable names are used, which aids in understanding the code's purpose. However, adding more comments could further improve readability, particularly in the more complex parts of Challenge 2.
- performance: The code's performance is efficient for the given tasks. The time complexity of the solutions is reasonable, and there are no obvious bottlenecks. String cleaning and type conversions are handled efficiently.
- security: The code appears secure for the given context. It handles user input (word and wallet amount) safely, without any immediate vulnerabilities. However, ensure proper sanitization and validation if integrating with external data sources or handling sensitive information.
