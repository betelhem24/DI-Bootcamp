Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately addresses both challenges as described in the chapter content. Challenge 1 correctly sorts comma-separated words alphabetically, and Challenge 2 finds the longest word in a sentence, adhering to all specified conditions.
- readability: The code is well-commented and uses descriptive variable names, making it easy to understand.
- performance: The solutions are efficient for the given problem sizes. Challenge 1 uses built-in `sorted` and `join` functions, and Challenge 2 iterates through the list once, resulting in linear time complexity.
- security: The code doesn't involve any external data sources or user-generated code execution, so it has no significant security concerns.
