suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 2, the code calculates `(99 * 3) * 8` instead of `(99**3) * 8`. Use the exponentiation operator `**` for calculating powers.
- In Exercise 3, the code should include comments indicating the predicted output before running the code.
- Consider adding more comments to explain the purpose of different sections of the code, enhancing readability.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code correctly addresses most of the exercises, including print statements, variable assignments, mathematical operations, comparison operators, if statements, and user input, as outlined in the chapter content. However, Exercise 2 has a mistake in the mathematical operation (should be power), and Exercise 3 lacks the predicted output comments as instructed, slightly reducing the correctness score.
- readability: The code is well-structured and uses meaningful variable names, enhancing readability. However, adding more comments, especially in sections with complex logic, would further improve readability.
- performance: The code is efficient and performs the required tasks without unnecessary computations or resource usage. Using f-strings for string formatting is a good practice for performance and readability.
- security: The code uses `input()` to get user input, which is inherently a potential security risk if not handled carefully. However, in these exercises, the input is mainly used for simple calculations or comparisons, so the risk is low. No significant security vulnerabilities are apparent.
