Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately implements all the requirements outlined in the problem description: it gets user input, validates the string length, prints the first and last characters, builds the string character by character using a loop, and shuffles the string as a bonus. All functionalities align perfectly with the chapter content.
- readability: The code is well-structured and easy to understand. Variable names are descriptive, and the code is properly indented, making it highly readable.
- performance: The code is efficient in its operations. Using a simple `for` loop and string slicing is performant for the given task and input size. Shuffling using `random.shuffle` is also efficient.
- security: The code does not involve any operations that are inherently insecure. It takes user input and processes it, but there's no risk of code injection or data exposure in this specific scenario.
