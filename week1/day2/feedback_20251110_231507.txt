suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding comments to explain the purpose of each section of the code.
- For Challenge 2, consider using a more descriptive variable name than 'letter'.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code correctly implements both challenges as described in the chapter content. Challenge 1 generates a list of multiples based on user input, and Challenge 2 removes consecutive duplicate letters from a user-provided string.
- readability: The code is well-structured and easy to understand. Variable names are generally descriptive, and the logic is straightforward. Adding more comments could further improve readability.
- performance: The code's performance is efficient for the given tasks. The loops and string operations are optimized for the problem sizes described in the examples.
- security: The code uses `input()` to get user data which is inherently risky. However, since only numerical input is expected in the first challenge, it could be more secure to implement a try-except block to catch and handle non-integer inputs. The code is reasonably secure for its intended purpose.
